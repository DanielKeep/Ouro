Ouro programming language
=========================

The Ouro programming language (pronounced *oo-roh*) is a small, functional
programming language inspired in parts by Lisp, Scheme, Haskell, Winamp AVS
and derived from MathEval_.

Although things like efficiency, usefulness and world domination would not be
unwelcome, the major aim is to be fun.

The name, incidentally, is taken from Ouroboros_, the serpent that eats its
own tail.
